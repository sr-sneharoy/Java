### **Answers to the Questions in the Image**

#### **11.1 What is a package?**
A **package** in Java is a namespace that organizes classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. It helps manage large-scale applications by grouping related classes and interfaces together. Packages provide:
- Code reusability.
- Encapsulation.
- Easier maintenance and organization.

For example:
```java
package com.example.utilities; // Declares a package named "utilities" under "com.example"
public class UtilityClass {
    public static void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Utility!");
    }
}
```

#### **11.2 How do we tell Java that we want to use a particular package in a file?**
To use a package, we use the `import` keyword.  
- Syntax:  
  ```java
  import package_name.ClassName; // To import a specific class
  import package_name.*;        // To import all classes in a package
  ```
- Example:
  ```java
  import java.util.Scanner;  // Imports the Scanner class from java.util package
  import java.util.*;        // Imports all classes from java.util package
  ```

---

#### **11.3 How do we design a package?**
To design a package:
1. **Define the package name** using the `package` keyword at the beginning of the file:
   ```java
   package myPackage;
   ```
2. **Save the file** in a directory structure that matches the package name. For example, if the package is `com.example.utilities`, the file should be saved in the folder `com/example/utilities`.

3. **Compile the class**:
   ```bash
   javac -d . MyClass.java
   ```
   This creates the required directory structure and places the compiled `.class` file in the correct package folder.

4. **Access the package** by importing it in other programs.

---

#### **11.4 How do we add a class or an interface to a package?**
To add a class or an interface to a package:
1. Open or create a `.java` file.
2. Use the `package` keyword at the top of the file.
   ```java
   package myPackage;
   public class MyClass {
       public void display() {
           System.out.println("Hello from MyClass in myPackage!");
       }
   }
   ```
3. Save the file in the corresponding package directory structure.
4. Compile using the `javac -d` command.

To add an interface:
```java
package myPackage;
public interface MyInterface {
    void displayMessage();
}
```

---

#### **1.5 Consider Program 10.2. Design a package to contain the class `student` and another package to contain the interface `sports`. Rewrite the program using these packages.**
- **Package for `student` class**:
  ```java
  package academic;
  public class Student {
      public String name;
      public int rollNo;

      public Student(String name, int rollNo) {
          this.name = name;
          this.rollNo = rollNo;
      }

      public void displayStudentInfo() {
          System.out.println("Name: " + name);
          System.out.println("Roll No: " + rollNo);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Package for `sports` interface**:
  ```java
  package activities;
  public interface Sports {
      void play();
  }
  ```

- **Main Program**:
  ```java
  import academic.Student;
  import activities.Sports;

  public class MainProgram implements Sports {
      public void play() {
          System.out.println("Playing a sport!");
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Student student = new Student("Alice", 101);
          student.displayStudentInfo();

          MainProgram mp = new MainProgram();
          mp.play();
      }
  }
  ```

#### **1.6 Discuss the various levels of access protection available for packages and their implications.**

| **Access Modifier** | **Same Class** | **Same Package** | **Subclass** | **Other Packages** |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **private**          | Yes            | No               | No           | No                 |
| **default** (no modifier) | Yes      | Yes              | No           | No                 |
| **protected**        | Yes            | Yes              | Yes          | No                 |
| **public**           | Yes            | Yes              | Yes          | Yes                |

- **Implications**:
  - Use `private` for implementation details that should not be accessed outside the class.
  - Use `default` when the class and its members are used only within the same package.
  - Use `protected` for members that need to be accessed in subclasses, even if they are in different packages.
  - Use `public` for APIs and functionalities meant to be globally accessible.

---

#### **1.7 What is static import? How is it useful?**
- **Static Import**:  
  Allows the direct use of static members (fields and methods) of a class without needing to qualify them with the class name.

- **Syntax**:
  ```java
  import static package_name.ClassName.staticMember;
  import static package_name.ClassName.*;
  ```

- **Example Without Static Import**:
  ```java
  Math.sqrt(25);
  Math.PI;
  ```

- **Example With Static Import**:
  ```java
  import static java.lang.Math.*;

  System.out.println(sqrt(25)); // No need to qualify with Math
  System.out.println(PI);
  ```

- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces verbosity in code.
  - Makes code cleaner and easier to read.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Overuse can reduce code clarity by hiding the source of static members.

#### **12.1 What is a thread?**  
A **thread** is the smallest unit of a program that can execute independently. It allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. In Java, threads enable multitasking within a single process.

---

#### **12.2 What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading? What is to be done to implement these in a program?**  

| **Feature**           | **Multiprocessing**                          | **Multithreading**                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Uses multiple processes with separate memory spaces. | Uses multiple threads within a single process. |
| **Communication**      | Inter-process communication (more complex). | Threads share memory, so communication is easier. |
| **Overhead**           | Higher because processes are isolated.       | Lower because threads share resources.   |
| **Implementation**     | Requires creating processes via libraries (e.g., `ProcessBuilder` in Java). | Requires creating threads using `Thread` or `Runnable` interface. |

**To Implement Multithreading in Java**:  
1. Extend the `Thread` class or implement the `Runnable` interface.  
2. Override the `run()` method.  
3. Start the thread using `Thread.start()`.  

---

#### **12.3 What Java interface must be implemented by all threads?**  
The **`Runnable` interface** must be implemented by all threads.  
It defines a single method:  
```java
public void run();
```

---

#### **12.4 How do we start a thread?**  
To start a thread:
1. Create a class that implements `Runnable` or extends `Thread`.
2. Implement the `run()` method.
3. Create an instance of the class and call `start()`.

Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // Starts the thread and invokes the run() method
    }
}
```

---

#### **12.5 What are the two methods by which we may stop threads?**  
1. **Using a flag**:  
   Set a boolean variable to control the execution of the thread.  
   ```java
   public class MyThread extends Thread {
       private boolean running = true;

       public void run() {
           while (running) {
               System.out.println("Thread running...");
           }
       }

       public void stopThread() {
           running = false;
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Interrupting the thread**:  
   Use the `interrupt()` method to stop a thread.  
   ```java
   thread.interrupt();
   ```

---

#### **12.6 What is the difference between suspending and stopping a thread?**  
- **Suspending a Thread**:  
  Temporarily pauses the thread’s execution without terminating it. Deprecated methods: `suspend()` and `resume()`.  

- **Stopping a Thread**:  
  Terminates the thread permanently. Deprecated method: `stop()`.

Modern practice is to use flags or `interrupt()` to control thread execution.

---

#### **12.7 How do we set priorities for threads?**  
Thread priorities determine the order in which threads are executed by the thread scheduler.  

Use the `setPriority()` method:  
```java
Thread t = new Thread();
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // 10
t.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // 1
t.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // 5 (default)
```

---

#### **12.8 Describe the complete life cycle of a thread.**  

1. **New**: A thread is created using the `Thread` class but has not yet started.  
   Example: `Thread t = new Thread();`
   
2. **Runnable**: The `start()` method is called, and the thread is ready to run. It waits for CPU time.  
   Example: `t.start();`
   
3. **Running**: The thread is currently executing.  

4. **Blocked/Waiting

**/Timed Waiting**: The thread is temporarily inactive, waiting for a resource or time interval to elapse.

5. **Terminated**: The thread has completed execution or has been stopped.

---

#### **12.9 What is synchronization? When do we use it?**  
**Synchronization** ensures that multiple threads do not simultaneously access shared resources, preventing data inconsistencies.

It is used:
- When multiple threads access shared resources like files or variables.
- To prevent race conditions.

Example:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

---

#### **12.10 Develop a simple real-life application program to illustrate the use of multithreads.**  
Example: A banking system where multiple threads handle account deposits and withdrawals simultaneously.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;

    public synchronized void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Deposited " + amount + ", Balance: " + balance);
    }

    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawn " + amount + ", Balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance!");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> account.deposit(500));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(300));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

Here are the answers to the questions in the image:

---

#### **14.1 What is an applet?**  
An **applet** is a small Java program that is designed to run in a web browser or an applet viewer. It is typically embedded in an HTML page and executed on the client-side, often used for interactive web applications.

---

#### **14.2 What is a local applet?**  
A **local applet** is one that is stored on the local system. It can be loaded and executed by the browser or applet viewer without needing to download it from a remote server.

---

#### **14.3 What is a remote applet?**  
A **remote applet** is one that is located on a web server and is downloaded to the client’s machine when the HTML page containing the applet is accessed.

---

#### **14.4 Explain the client/server relationship as applied to Java applets.**  
Java applets follow the **client/server model**:
- The applet resides on the server.
- When the client (browser) accesses the server, the applet is downloaded to the client machine and executed within the client’s browser.

---

#### **14.5 How do applets differ from application programs?**  
- **Execution**: Applets run inside a web browser, while applications run independently.
- **Security**: Applets operate in a restricted environment (sandbox) for security, while applications have full access to the system.
- **User Interface**: Applets often rely on web-based UIs, while applications use standalone graphical or command-line interfaces.

---

#### **14.6 Discuss the steps involved in developing and running a local applet.**  
1. Write the Java applet code.
2. Save the file with a `.java` extension.
3. Compile the applet using `javac`, producing a `.class` file.
4. Create an HTML file to embed the applet using the `<applet>` or `<object>` tag.
5. Open the HTML file in a browser or applet viewer to run the applet.

---

#### **14.7 Discuss the steps involved in loading and running a remote applet.**  
1. Develop and compile the applet as described for a local applet.
2. Host the `.class` file and the HTML page containing the applet tag on a web server.
3. Access the HTML page through a web browser. The browser will download and execute the applet from the server.

---

#### **14.8 Describe the various sections of a web page.**  
A typical web page contains:
1. **Head section**: Includes metadata, title, styles, and scripts.
2. **Body section**: Contains the main content like text, images, applets, and interactive elements.
3. **Footer section**: Displays additional information such as copyright details or contact information.

---

#### **14.9 How many arguments can be passed to an applet using `<PARAM>` tags?**  
There is no fixed limit on the number of arguments that can be passed to an applet using `<PARAM>` tags. Each `<PARAM>` tag represents a single parameter with a name and a value.

---

#### **14.10 Why do applet classes need to be declared as public?**  
Applet classes must be declared as `public` so that they are accessible to the browser or applet viewer. If the class is not `public`, the browser will not be able to load the applet.

---

#### **14.11 Describe the different stages in the life cycle of an applet. Distinguish between `init()` and `start()` methods.**  
The life cycle of an applet includes:
1. **Initialization (`init()`)**: Called when the applet is first loaded. Used to initialize resources.
2. **Start (`start()`)**: Called when the applet becomes visible or active. It can be invoked multiple times if the applet is restarted.
3. **Stop (`stop()`)**: Called when the applet is no longer visible or active.
4. **Destroy (`destroy()`)**: Called when the applet is terminated.

**Difference**:
- `init()`: Executed only once when the applet is initialized.
- `start()`: Executed each time the applet starts or resumes.

---

#### **14.12 Develop an applet that receives three numeric values as input from the user and then displays the largest of the three on the screen. Write an HTML page and test the applet.**  

**Java Code**:  
```java
import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class LargestNumberApplet extends Applet implements ActionListener {
    TextField num1, num2, num3;
    Button findLargest;
    Label result;

    public void init() {
        add(new Label("Enter first number:"));
        num1 = new TextField(5);
        add(num1);

        add(new Label("Enter second number:"));
        num2 = new TextField(5);
        add(num2);

        add(new Label("Enter third number:"));
        num3 = new TextField(5);
        add(num3);

        findLargest = new Button("Find Largest");
        findLargest.addActionListener(this);
        add(findLargest);

        result = new Label("Result will be displayed here");
        add(result);
    }

    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        int n1 = Integer.parseInt(num1.getText());
        int n2 = Integer.parseInt(num2.getText());
        int n3 = Integer.parseInt(num3.getText());

        int largest = Math.max(n1, Math.max(n2, n3));
        result.setText("Largest: " + largest);
    }
}
```

**HTML Code**:  
```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Applet Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <applet code="LargestNumberApplet.class" width="300" height="200"></applet>
</body>
</html>
```

Here are the answers to the questions in the image:

---

### **16.1 What is a file? Why do we require files to store data?**  
- A **file** is a named location on a storage device used to store data permanently.
- Files are required because:
  - They enable persistent storage of data, even after the program terminates.
  - They allow easy sharing and retrieval of large amounts of data.
  - They provide a structured way to manage and organize data.

---

### **16.2 What is a stream? How is the concept of streams used in Java?**  
- A **stream** is a sequence of data elements made available over time. It acts as a conduit for data to flow between a program and an input/output device.
- In Java, streams are used for handling I/O operations such as reading from or writing to files, memory, or network connections.

---

### **16.3 What are input and output streams? Explain them with illustrations.**  
- **Input Stream**: Used to read data into a program from a source (e.g., file, keyboard).  
  Example: `FileInputStream` reads data from a file.
  
- **Output Stream**: Used to write data from a program to a destination (e.g., file, console).  
  Example: `FileOutputStream` writes data to a file.

**Illustration**:  
```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
int data = fis.read(); // Reads a byte of data
fis.close();

FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
fos.write(data); // Writes a byte of data
fos.close();
```

---

### **16.4 What is a stream class? How are stream classes classified?**  
- A **stream class** is a Java class designed to handle input or output operations.  
- Stream classes are classified as:
  1. **Byte Streams**: Handle binary data (e.g., `InputStream`, `OutputStream`).
  2. **Character Streams**: Handle textual data (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`).

---

### **16.5 Describe the major tasks of input and output stream classes.**  
1. **Input Stream Classes**: Read data from a source (e.g., file, memory).
2. **Output Stream Classes**: Write data to a destination (e.g., file, console).

---

### **16.6 Distinguish between InputStream and Reader classes.**  
| **InputStream**                     | **Reader**                        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Handles binary data.                | Handles character data.           |
| Reads data byte by byte.            | Reads data character by character.|
| Example: `FileInputStream`.         | Example: `FileReader`.            |

---

### **16.7 Distinguish between OutputStream and Writer classes.**  
| **OutputStream**                    | **Writer**                        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Handles binary data.                | Handles character data.           |
| Writes data byte by byte.           | Writes data character by character.|
| Example: `FileOutputStream`.        | Example: `FileWriter`.            |

---

### **16.8 Describe the functions of the File class.**  
The `File` class provides methods to handle file and directory operations, such as:
- `createNewFile()`: Creates a new file.
- `exists()`: Checks if a file exists.
- `delete()`: Deletes a file.
- `mkdir()`: Creates a new directory.
- `length()`: Returns the size of a file.
- `list()`: Lists files in a directory.

---

### **16.9 Describe the most commonly used classes for handling file-related exceptions.**  
The most commonly used classes include:
- **IOException**: Represents general input/output exceptions.
- **FileNotFoundException**: Occurs when a file is not found.
- **EOFException**: Raised when the end of a file is reached unexpectedly.

---

### **16.10 State the steps involved in creating a disk file.**  
1. Create a `File` object representing the file.
2. Check if the file exists; if not, create it using `createNewFile()`.
3. Open the file using appropriate stream classes for writing data.
4. Close the stream after the operation is complete.

---

### **16.11 What is meant by initializing a file stream object? What are the ways of doing it? Give example code for each.**  
Initializing a file stream object means associating a file with a stream object to enable read/write operations.  
**Ways**:
1. **FileInputStream**: For reading binary data.
   ```java
   FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
   ```
2. **FileOutputStream**: For writing binary data.
   ```java
   FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("file.txt");
   ```

---

### **16.12 Which streams must always be used to process external files? Why?**  
- **FileInputStream** and **FileOutputStream** for binary files.
- **FileReader** and **FileWriter** for text files.  
They are specialized for handling files efficiently.

---

### **16.13 What is a random access file? How is it different from a sequential file? Why do we need a random access file?**  
- A **random access file** allows non-sequential reading/writing of data at any position in the file.  
- **Difference**:
  - Sequential files are read/write in order.
  - Random access files can jump to specific positions.
- **Need**: Useful for updating specific parts of large files without rewriting the entire file.

---

### **16.14 Create a DataInputStream for the file named “student.dat”.**  
```java
DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream("student.dat"));
```

---

### **16.15 Create a RandomAccessFile stream for the file “student.dat” for updating the student information in the file.**  
```java
RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile("student.dat", "rw");
```

---

### **16.16 Write statements to create a file stream that concatenates two existing files.**  
```java
FileInputStream fis1 = new FileInputStream("file1.txt");
FileInputStream fis2 = new FileInputStream("file2.txt");
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
SequenceInputStream sis = new SequenceInputStream(fis1, fis2);
int data;
while ((data = sis.read()) != -1) {
    fos.write(data);
}
sis.close();
fos.close();
```

---

### **16.17 How can we open an existing file for writing? If not, why?**  
- Use `FileWriter` or `FileOutputStream` to open an existing file for writing.  
- If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically unless specified otherwise.

---

### **16.18 Write a code to check whether a file to be opened for writing already exists.**  
```java
File file = new File("file.txt");
if (file.exists()) {
    System.out.println("File already exists!");
} else {
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);
    // Write to the file
    writer.close();
}
```

---

Here are the answers to the remaining questions from your image:

---

### **16.19 Write a code to check whether you have reached the end of the file.**  
For binary files:  
```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
while (fis.available() > 0) {
    int data = fis.read();
    System.out.println((char) data);
}
fis.close();
```

For text files:  
```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
String line;
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
br.close();
```

---

### **16.20 Write programs to write data to the following operations:**  
#### (a) Reading primitive data from a file  
```java
DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.dat"));
int num = dis.readInt();
double d = dis.readDouble();
System.out.println("Integer: " + num);
System.out.println("Double: " + d);
dis.close();
```

#### (b) Writing primitive data to a file  
```java
DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.dat"));
dos.writeInt(25);
dos.writeDouble(12.5);
dos.close();
```

### **16.21 Describe, through appropriate statements, how a double type value is read from the keyboard interactively.**  
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReadDouble {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a double value: ");
        double value = sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + value);
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

### **16.22 Write a program that counts the number of characters, words, and lines in the file.**  
```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileStats {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
        int charCount = 0, wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0;
        String line;

        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            lineCount++;
            charCount += line.length();
            wordCount += line.split("\\s+").length;
        }

        br.close();

        System.out.println("Characters: " + charCount);
        System.out.println("Words: " + wordCount);
        System.out.println("Lines: " + lineCount);
    }
}
```

### **16.23 Modify the above program so that it will also count the number of vowels in the file.**  
```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileStatsWithVowels {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
        int charCount = 0, wordCount = 0, lineCount = 0, vowelCount = 0;
        String line;
        String vowels = "AEIOUaeiou";

        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            lineCount++;
            charCount += line.length();
            wordCount += line.split("\\s+").length;
            for (char ch : line.toCharArray()) {
                if (vowels.indexOf(ch) != -1) {
                    vowelCount++;
                }
            }
        }

        br.close();

        System.out.println("Characters: " + charCount);
        System.out.println("Words: " + wordCount);
        System.out.println("Lines: " + lineCount);
        System.out.println("Vowels: " + vowelCount);
    }
}
```

### **16.24 Rewrite Program 16.3 using the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes.**  
This depends on Program 16.3 from your textbook, but here’s a generic version:  
```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");

int data;
while ((data = fis.read()) != -1) {
    fos.write(data);
}

fis.close();
fos.close();
```

### **16.25 Write a program to create a file named “Student.txt” and store the following data in it: Roll No, Name, and Marks.**  
```java
import java.io.*;

public class CreateStudentFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("Student.txt"));
        bw.write("Roll No: 101\n");
        bw.write("Name: John Doe\n");
        bw.write("Marks: 85\n");
        bw.close();
        System.out.println("Data written to Student.txt");
    }
}
```

### **16.26 Rewrite the contents of “Student.txt” in uppercase using the `RandomAccessFile` class.**  
```java
import java.io.*;

public class UppercaseStudentFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile("Student.txt", "rw");
        String line;
        long pointer = raf.getFilePointer();

        while ((line = raf.readLine()) != null) {
            raf.seek(pointer);
            raf.writeBytes(line.toUpperCase() + "\n");
            pointer = raf.getFilePointer();
        }

        raf.close();
        System.out.println("File converted to uppercase.");
    }
}
```

### **16.27 Rewrite the contents of Review Question 16.25 using a random access file so that we can add more records to the file later.**  
```java
import java.io.*;

public class AppendStudentRecords {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile("Student.txt", "rw");
        raf.seek(raf.length()); // Move to the end of the file
        raf.writeBytes("\nRoll No: 102\nName: Jane Doe\nMarks: 90\n");
        raf.close();
        System.out.println("New record added.");
    }
}
```

### **16.28 Write a program to print the details of alternate products stored in the random access file of Review Question 16.27.**  
```java
import java.io.*;

public class AlternateProducts {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile("Student.txt", "r");
        String line;
        boolean printLine = true;

        while ((line = raf.readLine()) != null) {
            if (printLine) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            printLine = !printLine;
        }

        raf.close();
    }
}
```
