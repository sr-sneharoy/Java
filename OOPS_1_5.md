### **Summary of Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming**  
*(From "Programming with Java" by E. Balagurusamy, 3rd Edition)*  

This chapter introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and its fundamental concepts, emphasizing why it is preferred over procedural programming.  

---

### **1. Introduction to Programming Paradigms**  
The chapter begins by explaining two major programming paradigms:  
- **Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)**:  
  - Based on functions/procedures.  
  - Emphasizes step-by-step instructions (e.g., C).  
  - Data is globally accessible, leading to security risks.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:  
  - Based on objects and classes.  
  - Encapsulates data, improving security and modularity.  

---

### **2. Basic Concepts of OOP**  
The key principles of OOP are explained:  

1. **Objects** – Real-world entities with states (attributes) and behaviors (methods).  
2. **Classes** – Blueprints for creating objects.  
3. **Encapsulation** – Wrapping data and methods inside a class for security.  
4. **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary parts.  
5. **Inheritance** – A class (child) can derive properties and methods from another class (parent).  
6. **Polymorphism** – The ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.  

---

### **3. Benefits of OOP**  
- Code reusability (via inheritance).  
- Better data security (via encapsulation).  
- Scalability and maintainability.  
- Better mapping to real-world problems.  

---

### **4. Java and OOP**  
The chapter also introduces Java as a **pure OOP language** with features that support OOP principles, such as:  
- Built-in garbage collection.  
- Platform independence (via JVM).  
- Strong type-checking and exception handling.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This chapter lays the foundation for understanding Java as an OOP language and why OOP is preferred for modern software development.



### **Answers to Chapter 1 Questions (Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming)**  

#### **1.1 What do you think are the major issues facing the software industry today?**  
Some major issues include:  
- **Security vulnerabilities** (cyberattacks, data breaches).  
- **Scalability challenges** (handling large amounts of data).  
- **Software maintenance and updates** (legacy system compatibility).  
- **Development speed vs. quality** (meeting deadlines without compromising code quality).  
- **AI and automation impact** (job displacement and ethical concerns).  

---

#### **1.2 Briefly discuss the software evolution during the period from 1950 to 1995.**  
- **1950s-1960s**: Assembly language and early procedural programming (Fortran, COBOL).  
- **1970s**: Structured programming (C, Pascal).  
- **1980s**: Object-oriented programming (C++, Smalltalk).  
- **1990s**: Internet revolution, Java introduced (platform-independent programming).  

---

#### **1.3 What is object-oriented programming? How is it different from procedure-oriented programming?**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** organizes code using **objects** (real-world entities) and **classes** (blueprints for objects).  
- **Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)** focuses on **functions** and step-by-step execution.  

**Key Differences:**  
| Feature | OOP | POP |  
|---------|-----|-----|  
| Structure | Objects & Classes | Functions & Procedures |  
| Data Access | Encapsulation (data hidden) | Global data sharing |  
| Code Reusability | Inheritance | Code repetition |  
| Approach | Data-driven | Algorithm-driven |  

---

#### **1.4 How are data and methods organized in an object-oriented program?**  
- Data is stored as **attributes (fields)** inside objects.  
- Methods (functions) operate on an object's data and define its behavior.  
- Access is controlled using **encapsulation** (public/private access).  

---

#### **1.5 What are the unique advantages of an object-oriented programming paradigm?**  
- **Code reusability** (via inheritance).  
- **Data security** (via encapsulation).  
- **Modularity** (easy to maintain and debug).  
- **Scalability** (good for large applications).  
- **Flexibility** (via polymorphism).  

---

#### **1.6 Distinguish between the following terms:**  

**(a) Objects and Classes**  
- **Class**: A blueprint/template for creating objects.  
- **Object**: An instance of a class with specific data and behavior.  

Example:  
```java
class Car {  
    String color;  
    void start() { System.out.println("Car started"); }  
}  
Car myCar = new Car();  // Object creation  
```

---

**(b) Data Abstraction and Data Encapsulation**  
- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details and only exposes necessary parts.  
- **Encapsulation**: Wraps data and methods inside a class to restrict direct access.  

Example of encapsulation:  
```java
class BankAccount {  
    private int balance;  // Hidden data  
    public void deposit(int amount) { balance += amount; }  
}  
```

---

**(c) Inheritance and Polymorphism**  
- **Inheritance**: One class derives properties/methods from another.  
- **Polymorphism**: Different classes respond differently to the same function call.  

Example:  
```java
class Animal { void sound() { System.out.println("Animal makes a sound"); } }  
class Dog extends Animal { void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); } }  
```

---

**(d) Dynamic Binding and Message Passing**  
- **Dynamic Binding**: Method call is resolved at runtime, enabling polymorphism.  
- **Message Passing**: Objects communicate by calling methods on each other.  

Example of dynamic binding:  
```java
Animal myPet = new Dog();  // Resolved at runtime  
myPet.sound();  // Outputs "Dog barks"  
```

---

#### **1.7 What kinds of things can become objects in OOP?**  
- **Real-world entities** (Car, Person, Bank Account).  
- **Abstract entities** (File System, Database Connection).  
- **User Interface components** (Buttons, Text Fields).  

---

#### **1.8 Describe inheritance as applied to OOP.**  
- Inheritance allows a **child class** to acquire properties and methods from a **parent class**.  
- Promotes **code reuse** and **hierarchical structure**.  
- Example:  
```java
class Parent { void show() { System.out.println("Parent class"); } }  
class Child extends Parent { }  
Child obj = new Child();  
obj.show();  // Inherited method from Parent  
```

---

#### **1.9 List a few areas of application of OOP technology.**  
- **Software development** (Java applications, Python programs).  
- **Game development** (Unity, Unreal Engine).  
- **Web applications** (Spring Boot, Django).  
- **Database systems** (MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- **AI & Machine Learning** (TensorFlow, PyTorch).  

---

#### **1.10 State whether the following statements are TRUE or FALSE**  

(a) **In conventional, procedure-oriented programming, all data are shared by all functions.**  
✅ **True** (In POP, global variables can be accessed by all functions).  

(b) **The main emphasis of procedure-oriented programming is on algorithms rather than on data.**  
✅ **True** (POP focuses on step-by-step execution rather than organizing data).  

---

### **Additional True/False Statements from Image**  

(e) **One of the striking features of object-oriented programming is the division of programs into objects that represent real-world entities.**  
✅ **True**  

(f) **Wrapping up of data of different types into a single unit is known as encapsulation.**  
✅ **True**  

(g) **One problem with OOP is that once a class is created, it can never be changed.**  
❌ **False** (A class can be modified or extended using inheritance).  

(h) **Inheritance means the ability to reuse the data values of one object by other objects.**  
❌ **False** (Inheritance allows reusing **methods and properties**, not just data).  

(i) **Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.**  
✅ **True** (Dynamic method binding allows derived classes to override parent class methods).  

(j) **Object-oriented programs are executed much faster than conventional programs.**  
❌ **False** (OOP may have slight overhead due to object management but improves maintainability).  

(k) **Object-oriented systems can scale up without becoming too large.**  
✅ **True** (OOP supports modularity and reusability, making it scalable).  

(l) **Object-oriented approach cannot be used to create databases.**  
❌ **False** (Many databases, such as **Object-Oriented Databases (OODBMS)**, are based on OOP principles).

| **Assignment** | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` | `a += b` |  
| **Ternary** | `? :` | `int min = (a < b) ? a : b;` |  

---

### **7. Control Statements**  
Control statements determine the flow of execution.  

1. **Conditional Statements:**  
   - `if`, `if-else`, `switch-case`  
   - Example:  
   ```java
   if (age >= 18) {  
       System.out.println("Eligible to vote");  
   } else {  
       System.out.println("Not eligible to vote");  
   }
   ```
  
2. **Looping Statements:**

   }  
   ```

---

### **8. Java Input/Output (I/O) Operations**  
Java provides different ways to handle input and output.  

- **Using Scanner Class (for user input):**  
  ```java
  import java.util.Scanner;
  public class UserInput {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
          System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
          String name = sc.nextLine();
          System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
      }
  }
  ```
- **Using `System.out.println()` (for output)**  
  - Prints text to the console.  

---

### **9. Type Conversion in Java**  
Java supports two types of type conversions:  
1. **Implicit Type Casting (Widening)** – Automatically converts smaller data types to larger ones.  
   ```java
   int num = 10;
   double d = num;  // Automatic conversion (int → double)
   ```
2. **Explicit Type Casting (Narrowing)** – Manually converts larger data types to smaller ones.  
   ```java
   double d = 10.99;
   int num = (int) d;  // Manual conversion (double → int)
   ```

---

### **10. Java Program Compilation and Execution Process**  
1. **Write Java Code** → `.java` file  
2. **Compile using `javac`** → Generates bytecode (`.class` file)  
3. **Run using `java` command** → Executes bytecode on JVM  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Chapter 3 provides a fundamental understanding of Java programming, covering:  
- The structure of Java programs.  
- Basic syntax and tokens.  
- Control structures and operators.  
- Input/output handling.

These concepts form the **foundation** for writing Java applications.



### **Summary of Chapter 3: Overview of Java Language**  
*(From "Programming with Java" by E. Balagurusamy, 3rd Edition)*  

This chapter provides an **introduction to Java syntax**, program structure, and fundamental concepts like tokens, statements, identifiers, and command-line arguments.  

---

## **1. Structure of a Typical Java Program**  
A Java program consists of:  
1. **Package Declaration** (optional)  
2. **Import Statements** (to include Java libraries)  
3. **Class Declaration** (main class)  
4. **Main Method** (entry point of execution)  
5. **Statements** (logic of the program)  

### **Example of a Basic Java Program**  
```java
// Package declaration (optional)
package myPackage;

// Importing required classes
import java.util.Scanner;

// Class Declaration
public class HelloWorld {
    // Main Method (Program Execution Starts Here)
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");  // Printing output
    }
}
```

---

## **2. Why Do We Need the `import` Statement?**  
- Java provides built-in libraries (`java.util`, `java.io`, etc.).  
- The `import` statement allows us to use these libraries **without writing full package names**.  

### **Example:** Importing Scanner Class  
```java
import java.util.Scanner;  // Importing Scanner for user input

public class UserInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
```
Without `import`, we must write `java.util.Scanner` every time.

---

## **3. Task of the `main()` Method**  
- The `main()` method is the **starting point** of any Java program.  
- It must be defined as:  
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) { }
  ```
- `args` (String array) allows **command-line arguments** to be passed.

---

## **4. What is a Token? Types of Tokens in Java**  
A **token** is the smallest meaningful element in a Java program.  

### **Types of Tokens:**  
1. **Keywords**: Reserved words (e.g., `class`, `static`, `if`, `while`).  
2. **Identifiers**: User-defined names for variables, methods, classes.  
3. **Literals**: Constant values (e.g., `100`, `'A'`, `"Hello"`).  
4. **Operators**: Symbols for operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `&&`).  
5. **Separators**: Symbols that define structure (e.g., `{}`, `;`, `()`).

## **5. Why Can't We Use a Keyword as a Variable Name?**  
- Java **keywords** (like `int`, `class`, `return`) have predefined meanings.  
- Using them as variable names **causes syntax errors**.  
- Example (Incorrect):  
  ```java
  int class = 10;  // Error: "class" is a keyword
  ```

---

## **6. Rules for Creating Identifiers**  
An **identifier** is the name of a variable, method, or class.  

### **Rules:**  
✔ Must begin with a **letter (A-Z, a-z), `_`, or `$`**  
✔ Can contain **letters, digits (0-9), `_`, and `$`**  
✔ **Case-sensitive** (`Name` and `name` are different)  
❌ Cannot be a **Java keyword**  
❌ Cannot contain **spaces or special characters**  

### **Valid Identifiers:**  
✔ `myVariable`, `_temp`, `$price`, `MaxSpeed`  
❌ `2number` (Cannot start with digit), `class` (Keyword), `name@` (Invalid character)

## **7. Java Naming Conventions**  
(Java does not enforce naming conventions, but following them improves readability.)  

| **Type** | **Convention** | **Example** |  
|----------|--------------|-------------|  
| **Class Names** | Start with **uppercase**, use CamelCase | `MyClass`, `StudentDetails` |  
| **Variable & Method Names** | Start with **lowercase**, use camelCase | `myAge`, `calculateSalary()` |  
| **Constants** | **All uppercase, with underscores** | `MAX_SPEED`, `PI_VALUE` |  

---

## **8. Separators in Java**  
Separators are **symbols** used to structure code.  

| **Separator** | **Use** | **Example** |  
|--------------|--------|-------------|  
| `.` | Access members of a class | `System.out.println()` |  
| `;` | End of a statement | `int a = 10;` |  
| `{}` | Block of code | `if (x > 0) { ... }` |  
| `()` | Method parameters | `main(String[] args)` |  
| `[]` | Arrays | `int[] arr = new int[5];` |  
| `,` | Separate variables/parameters | `int a, b, c;` |  

---

## **9. What is a Statement? How Do Java Statements Differ from C/C++?**  
- A **statement** is an instruction in Java (e.g., assignments, loops, method calls).  
- Java **statements** end with `;` like C/C++, but Java:  
  ✔ Uses **garbage collection** (no `malloc/free` like C)  
  ✔ Uses **exception handling (`try-catch`)**  
  ✔ Has **strict type checking**  

---

## **10. Steps to Implement a Stand-Alone Program**  
1. **Write Code** in a `.java` file.  
2. **Compile** using `javac` (e.g., `javac MyProgram.java`).  
3. **Run** using `java` (e.g., `java MyProgram`).  

---

## **11. Command-Line Arguments in Java**  
Java allows passing arguments when executing a program.  

### **Example:**  
```java
public class CommandLineExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("First Argument: " + args[0]);
    }
}
```
**Run:**  
```sh
java CommandLineExample Hello
```
**Output:**  
```
First Argument: Hello
```
---

## **12. Java as a Freeform Language**  
- Unlike languages with **strict syntax structures** (like Python), Java is **freeform** because:  
  ✔ **Whitespace is ignored**  
  ✔ **Code blocks (`{}`) define structure, not indentation**  
  ✔ **Statements can be written on the same or different lines**  

**Example:**  
✔ **Valid** (Single-line)  
```java
if (x > 0) System.out.println("Positive");
```
✔ **Valid** (Multiline)  
```java
if (x > 0) { 
    System.out.println("Positive"); 
}
```

## **Conclusion**  
Chapter 3 covers the **basic structure of Java programs**, syntax elements, identifiers, naming rules, and execution steps. Understanding these concepts is **crucial** for writing Java programs efficiently.


---

### **Summary of Chapter 4: Constants, Variables, and Data Types**  
*(From "Programming with Java" by E. Balagurusamy, 3rd Edition)*  

This chapter covers the fundamental building blocks of Java programming, including **constants, variables, and data types**. It explains how data is stored, manipulated, and used in Java programs.  

---

## **1. Constants in Java**  
Constants are fixed values that do not change during program execution. In Java, constants are declared using the `final` keyword.  

### **Types of Constants**  
1. **Integer Constants**: Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-20`).  
2. **Floating-Point Constants**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `2.718`).  
3. **Character Constants**: A single character enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'A'`).  
4. **String Constants**: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Hello"`).  
5. **Boolean Constants**: Only `true` or `false`.  

### **Example of Constant Declaration**  
```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
```
- The `final` keyword ensures that the value cannot be changed.  

---

## **2. Variables in Java**  
A **variable** is a memory location used to store data. Java requires every variable to have a specific **data type**.  

### **Declaring and Initializing Variables**  
```java
int age = 25;       // Integer variable  
double price = 99.99; // Floating-point variable  
char grade = 'A';   // Character variable  
boolean isJavaFun = true; // Boolean variable  
```

### **Types of Variables**  
1. **Instance Variables** – Defined inside a class but outside methods.  
2. **Static Variables** – Declared using `static`, shared by all objects of a class.  
3. **Local Variables** – Declared inside methods or blocks.  
4. **Final Variables** – Constants that cannot be modified after initialization.  

---

## **3. Data Types in Java**  
Java provides two main categories of data types:  

### **A. Primitive Data Types**  
Primitive data types store basic values directly in memory.  

| Data Type | Size | Default Value | Example |  
|-----------|------|--------------|---------|  
| `byte` | 1 byte | `0` | `byte b = 100;` |  
| `short` | 2 bytes | `0` | `short s = 2000;` |  
| `int` | 4 bytes | `0` | `int i = 50000;` |  
| `long` | 8 bytes | `0L` | `long l = 100000L;` |  
| `float` | 4 bytes | `0.0f` | `float f = 5.75f;` |  
| `double` | 8 bytes | `0.0d` | `double d = 99.99;` |  
| `char` | 2 bytes | `'\u0000'` | `char c = 'A';` |  
| `boolean` | 1 bit | `false` | `boolean flag = true;` |  

---

### **B. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types**  
These data types store references (memory addresses) to objects.  

| Type | Example |  
|------|---------|  
| Arrays | `int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};` |  
| Strings | `String name = "Java";` |  
| Classes | `MyClass obj = new MyClass();` |  

---

## **4. Type Casting in Java**  
Java supports **type conversion** between different data types.  

### **A. Implicit Type Casting (Widening)**  
- Smaller types are automatically converted to larger types.  
```java
int num = 10;
double d = num;  // int → double (Automatic)
```

### **B. Explicit Type Casting (Narrowing)**  
- Larger types need to be explicitly converted to smaller types.  
```java
double price = 99.99;
int newPrice = (int) price;  // double → int (Manual)
```

---

## **5. Type Promotion in Expressions**  
- In Java, smaller data types (`byte`, `short`, `char`) are promoted to `int` when used in arithmetic operations.  
```java
byte a = 10;
byte b = 20;
int result = a + b;  // a and b are promoted to int
```
- If one operand is `double`, the entire expression converts to `double`.  

---

## **6. Variable Scope and Lifetime**  
The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed.  

| Type | Scope | Lifetime |  
|------|-------|----------|  
| Local Variable | Inside a method/block | Only during method execution |  
| Instance Variable | Inside a class but outside methods | As long as the object exists |  
| Static Variable | Shared among all instances | Exists throughout program execution |  

---

## **7. Java String Handling**  
Java provides the `String` class to handle text.  

### **Declaring Strings**  
```java
String message = "Hello, Java!";
```
### **Common String Methods**  
| Method | Description | Example |  
|--------|------------|---------|  
| `length()` | Returns string length | `message.length()` |  
| `toUpperCase()` | Converts to uppercase | `message.toUpperCase()` |  
| `toLowerCase()` | Converts to lowercase | `message.toLowerCase()` |  
| `concat()` | Joins two strings | `str1.concat(str2)` |  
| `charAt()` | Gets character at index | `message.charAt(0)` |  

---

## **8. Java Input and Output (I/O) Handling**  
### **A. Taking User Input (Scanner Class)**  
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class UserInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
```
### **B. Output using `System.out.println()`**  
```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");  
```

---

## **9. Operators in Java**  
Java supports different types of operators for performing computations.  

| Type | Operators | Example |  
|------|----------|---------|  
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | `a + b` |  
| Relational | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | `a > b` |  
| Logical | `&&`, `||`, `!` | `(a > b) && (b < c)` |  
| Bitwise | `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` | `a & b` |  
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` | `a += b` |  
| Ternary | `? :` | `int min = (a < b) ? a : b;` |  

---

## **10. Summary of Key Points**  
1. **Constants** are declared using `final` and cannot be changed.  
2. **Variables** store values and have different types (`int`, `double`, `String`, etc.).  
3. **Primitive Data Types** store single values, while **Reference Types** store memory addresses.  
4. **Type Casting** allows conversion between different data types.  
5. **String Handling** in Java uses the `String` class with built-in methods.  
6. **Operators** perform arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.  
7. **Java Input/Output (I/O)** can be handled using `Scanner` and `System.out.println()`.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
Chapter 4 provides a **strong foundation** for handling data in Java. Understanding constants, variables, and data types is **essential** for writing efficient Java programs.
---

Here’s a summary of Chapter 4 ("Constants, Variables, and Data Types") from *Programming with Java* by E. Balagurusamy (3rd Edition):

### **Chapter 4: Constants, Variables, and Data Types**

#### **4.1 What is a Constant?**
A constant is a fixed value that does not change during the execution of a program. In Java, constants can be declared using the `final` keyword.

#### **4.2 What is a Variable?**
A variable is a storage location in memory with a name and a type. Its value can change during program execution.

#### **4.3 Importance of Constants and Variables in Programming**
- **Variables** store data that can be modified during execution.
- **Constants** store fixed values, ensuring data integrity and avoiding accidental modifications.

#### **4.4 Basic Data Types in Java**
Java provides eight primitive data types:
1. **byte** (8-bit integer)
2. **short** (16-bit integer)
3. **int** (32-bit integer)
4. **long** (64-bit integer)
5. **float** (32-bit floating point)
6. **double** (64-bit floating point)
7. **char** (16-bit Unicode character)
8. **boolean** (`true` or `false`)

#### **4.5 Scope of a Variable**
The scope defines the region where a variable is accessible. Java has:
- **Local variables** (declared inside a method/block)
- **Instance variables** (declared inside a class, outside methods)
- **Static variables** (shared among all objects of a class)

#### **4.6 Type Casting and Its Importance**
Type casting converts one data type into another:
- **Implicit casting (Widening)** – smaller to larger type (e.g., `int` to `double`)
- **Explicit casting (Narrowing)** – larger to smaller type (e.g., `double` to `int`)

#### **4.7 Initialization and Its Importance**
Initializing variables prevents garbage values and improves program stability.

#### **4.8 Handling Large/Small Numbers for Accuracy**
Use the `BigDecimal` class for precision in financial calculations.

#### **4.9 Symbolic Constants**
A symbolic constant is a variable declared with `final`, meaning its value cannot be changed. Example:
```java
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
```
It improves code readability and maintainability.

#### **4.10 Invalid Constants**
- `5 * 1.5` (Expression, not a constant)
- `RS 75.50` (Invalid currency format)
- `“15.75”` (String, not a numeric constant)

#### **4.11 Invalid Variable Names**
- `first.Name` (Dot `.` is not allowed)
- `n1 + n2` (Operators are not allowed)
- `3rd-row` (Variable names cannot start with numbers)

#### **4.12 Identifying Errors in Declaration**
Some issues include:
- `int x;` (Valid)
- `double p = q;` (`q` is not initialized)
- `character C1;` (Incorrect type, should be `char`)

#### **4.13 Harmonic Series Program**
Write a program to calculate:
\[
1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{n}
\]
Where `n` is input by the user.

#### **4.14 Price Calculation in Paise**
Convert decimal values of money into paise.

#### **4.15 Temperature Conversion (Fahrenheit to Celsius)**
Use the formula:
\[
C = \frac{(F - 32)}{1.8}
\]

#### **Debugging Exercises**
Example:
```java
public static void display() {
    int x = 123456;
    float f = 100.12;
    System.out.println("Float Value = " + f);
}
```
Errors:
- `int x = 123456;` (Might exceed valid `int` range)
- `float f = 100.12;` (Should be `100.12f`)

### **Chapter 5: Operators and Expressions**  
(*Programming with Java* by E. Balagurusamy, 3rd Edition)  

---

### **5.1 Operators in Java**  
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Java provides several types of operators:

#### **1. Arithmetic Operators**  
Used for mathematical operations:  
| Operator | Description | Example (`a=10, b=5`) |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| `+` | Addition | `a + b = 15` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `a - b = 5` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `a * b = 50` |
| `/` | Division | `a / b = 2` |
| `%` | Modulus (Remainder) | `a % b = 0` |

---

#### **2. Relational (Comparison) Operators**  
Used to compare values:  
| Operator | Description | Example (`a=10, b=5`) | Output |
|----------|------------|------------------------|--------|
| `==` | Equal to | `a == b` | `false` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `a != b` | `true` |
| `>` | Greater than | `a > b` | `true` |
| `<` | Less than | `a < b` | `false` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b` | `true` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `a <= b` | `false` |

---

#### **3. Logical Operators**  
Used for logical operations:  
| Operator | Description | Example (`a=10, b=5`) | Output |
|----------|------------|------------------------|--------|
| `&&` | Logical AND | `(a > b) && (b > 0)` | `true` |
| `||` | Logical OR | `(a < b) || (b > 0)` | `true` |
| `!` | Logical NOT | `!(a > b)` | `false` |

---

#### **4. Bitwise Operators**  
Work at the bit level:  
| Operator | Description | Example (`a=5, b=3`) | Output |
|----------|------------|------------------------|--------|
| `&` | Bitwise AND | `a & b` | `1` |
| `|` | Bitwise OR | `a | b` | `7` |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR | `a ^ b` | `6` |
| `~` | Bitwise Complement | `~a` | `-6` |
| `<<` | Left Shift | `a << 1` | `10` |
| `>>` | Right Shift | `a >> 1` | `2` |

---

#### **5. Assignment Operators**  
Used to assign values:  
| Operator | Description | Example (`a = 10`) | Output |
|----------|------------|----------------------|--------|
| `=` | Assign | `a = 5` | `5` |
| `+=` | Add & Assign | `a += 5` | `15` |
| `-=` | Subtract & Assign | `a -= 5` | `5` |
| `*=` | Multiply & Assign | `a *= 2` | `20` |
| `/=` | Divide & Assign | `a /= 2` | `5` |
| `%=` | Modulus & Assign | `a %= 3` | `1` |

---

#### **6. Increment and Decrement Operators**  
Used to increase or decrease values:  
| Operator | Description | Example (`a=5`) | Output |
|----------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| `++` | Increment | `++a` | `6` |
| `--` | Decrement | `--a` | `4` |

- **Pre-Increment (`++a`)**: Increments before using the value.  
- **Post-Increment (`a++`)**: Increments after using the value.

---

#### **7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator**  
Shortens if-else conditions:  
```java
int x = (a > b) ? a : b;
```
Equivalent to:
```java
if (a > b) x = a;
else x = b;
```

---

### **5.2 Expressions in Java**  
An expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators that evaluates to a value.  
Examples:
```java
int result = (10 + 5) * 3;  // result = 45
```

#### **Types of Expressions:**
1. **Arithmetic Expression**: Uses arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /, %`).
2. **Relational Expression**: Uses relational operators (`==, !=, >, <`).
3. **Logical Expression**: Uses logical operators (`&&, ||, !`).
4. **Bitwise Expression**: Uses bitwise operators (`&, |, ^, <<, >>`).

---

### **5.3 Operator Precedence and Associativity**  
Operators have precedence (priority). If two operators have the same precedence, associativity decides the execution order.

#### **Operator Precedence Table**
| Precedence | Operators | Associativity |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Highest** | `()` `[]` `.` | Left to Right |
| | `++` `--` | Right to Left |
| | `*` `/` `%` | Left to Right |
| | `+` `-` | Left to Right |
| | `<<` `>>` `>>>` | Left to Right |
| | `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Left to Right |
| | `==` `!=` | Left to Right |
| | `&` | Left to Right |
| | `^` | Left to Right |
| | `|` | Left to Right |
| | `&&` | Left to Right |
| | `||` | Left to Right |
| | `?:` | Right to Left |
| **Lowest** | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` | Right to Left |

Example:
```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2; // Multiplication first, then addition (Result: 20)
```

---

### **5.4 Type Conversions in Expressions**  
Java automatically converts smaller types to larger types during calculations.

**Implicit Type Conversion (Widening Conversion)**:  
Occurs automatically when:
- `byte → short → int → long → float → double`

Example:
```java
int a = 10;
double b = a;  // Implicit conversion
```

**Explicit Type Conversion (Narrowing Conversion)**:  
Must be done manually using type casting.

Example:
```java
double a = 10.5;
int b = (int) a;  // Explicit conversion
```

---

### **5.5 Special Operators**  
1. **`instanceof` Operator**  
   - Checks if an object belongs to a class.
   ```java
   String str = "Hello";
   boolean result = str instanceof String;  // true
   ```

2. **Dot (`.`) Operator**  
   - Accesses methods and variables of an object.
   ```java
   System.out.println("Hello");  // Accessing `println` method
   ```

---

### **5.6 Evaluating Expressions**  
Java evaluates expressions based on **precedence** and **associativity**.  
Example:
```java
int x = 5 + 3 * 2;  // 5 + (3 * 2) = 11
```

---

### **Conclusion**  
- Java provides a variety of **operators** for different operations.  
- **Operator precedence** affects how expressions are evaluated.  
- **Type conversion** ensures compatibility between data types.  
- Using **expressions** effectively helps in writing efficient programs.
